Welcome. Here I'll include general introductions to various projects and endeavors, and a link for looking into the details.

## [](#header-2)HackerBoxes and Instructables
I really enjoyed getting into the [hackerboxes](https://hackerboxes.com/) when I get time, and I found that I also really enjoyed making simple how-to tutorials to help myself and anyone else who is interested. I've been publishing them on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/member/jumson/) and here are some individual links.

### [](#header-3)Hacker Tracker
[The HackerTracker](http://www.instructables.com/id/Hacker-Tracker-in-Depth/) is a device that melds together a GPS module, SD Card Module, an Arduino Nano and a 3-Axis Compass.

### [](#header-3)Circuit Circus
[Assembling](https://www.instructables.com/id/Circuit-Circus-in-Depth-Tech/) and [Operating](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Operate-the-Transistor-Tester-With-AVR-Micr/) the "Circuit Circus" Circuit and Component Tester.

### [](#header-3)A Technique for Soldering SMD components
As I was experimenting with small electronics, I realized I do not really have all the tools I need. I developed this little technique and some people seemed to appreciate it.

### [](#header-3)Tinning Tips
I made this small tutorial to show a way I was using to tin tips of little twisted wires to help with future soldering. I used a different camera this tmie and the image quality was not as good.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>

<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
