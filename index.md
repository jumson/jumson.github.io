Welcome. Here I'll include general introductions to various projects and endeavors, and a link for looking into the details.

### [](#header-3)HackerBoxes and Instructables

I really enjoyed getting into the [hackerboxes](https://hackerboxes.com/) when I get time, and I found that I also really enjoyed making simple how-to tutorials to help myself and anyone else who is interested. I've been publishing them on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/member/jumson/) and here are some individual links:
[The HackerTracker](http://www.instructables.com/id/Hacker-Tracker-in-Depth/) is a device that melds together a GPS module, SD Card Module, an Arduino Nano and a 3-Axis Compass.

[Assembling](https://www.instructables.com/id/Circuit-Circus-in-Depth-Tech/) and [Operating](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Operate-the-Transistor-Tester-With-AVR-Micr/) the "Circuit Circus" Circuit and Component Tester. ![]()

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
